        hope to continue our qualifying streak this FY20-21 season, working hard
        to possibly make it to Worlds. We are currently striving to spread STEM
        to as many youth as possible within our Bay Area communities through
        online camps. Additionally, we will be working hard over the summer to
        implement new design ideas and train for the upcoming season.
